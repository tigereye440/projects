# Project structure
This repository is for personal projects I am undertaking to learn and sharpen my programming skills. Feel free to contact me if you have any comments or contributions.
This project repository will be divided into three groups based on the complexity of the projects. The complexity of each project in each group is based on suggestions by Andy Sterks "3 levels of Portfolio projects" as explained in [this](https://youtu.be/RYE0QQKJI9o) video. 

## Group 1 (Basic/Simple)
Group 1 projects are very simple and do at most 2 things. Projects in this group are made using Vanilla Javascript. All Group 1 projects will be reinvented in Group 2 to add more functionality

## Group 2 (Intermediate)
Group 2 projects are fairly complex and those at most five things. They have relatively long codes and may use external JavaScript libraries. Group two projects are projects that may be done by an intermediary experienced programmer.

## Level 3 (Capstone)
Level three projects are capstone projects that encapsulate everything I can do as a programmer. This will be a clone of a famous website or CDN.
